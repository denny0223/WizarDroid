Overview
--------

This project frok from [WizarDroid](https://github.com/Nimrodda/WizarDroid), add indicator use library [Android-ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator).

WizarDroid is a lightweight Android library, developed by CodePond.org, that addresses a feature that Android is surprisingly missing, Wizards. It is built on top of Android's ViewPager to enable slide animation and touch functionality.
Implementation is done mainly by extending __BasicWizardLayout__ class.

Key advantages:

* Built-in basic wizard layout with paging and slide animation
* Wizard context for persisting data in the wizard
* Compatible with other libraries such as [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/)
* Support for nested fragments
* Wizard's flow is defined in one place and can be maintained easily
* Simple API for controlling wizard's flow in runtime 


More info is available on WizarDroid [home page](http://wizardroid.codepond.org).
